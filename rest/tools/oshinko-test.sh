#!/bin/bash
#
# This script is for running the oshinko-rest tests. It can be used to
# run either the unit tests, or the full client end-to-end tests. In the
# case of the latter, the tests assume that the execution shell has access
# to the `oc` command, and that a user with sufficient privileges has been
# authenticated.
#
# The unit tests are run by executing the standard Go language test command
# on the command line within the repository.
#
# The client tests are run by building a container within OpenShift based on
# a reference into the oshinko-rest source repository, then using the Go
# test command to invoke a series of tests that will run an oshinko-rest
# server and execute client calls against that server. The client tests will
# exercise the actual OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs to create, read, update,
# and destroy objects.
#
# As these two tests are radically different in execution and style, special
# care should be taken before running the client tests as they will execute
# commands against a running OpenShift installation.

# This script will exit if there is an error with any command, be sure that
# the user you are logged in as in OpenShift can perform the necessary
# cluster operations.
