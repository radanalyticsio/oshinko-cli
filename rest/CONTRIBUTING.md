# Contributing to oshinko-rest

The oshinko-rest application is a Go language based REST server that is
defined by an OpenAPI (fka Swagger) file in `api/swagger.yaml`. From this
file, the framework of the REST application is generated by using the
[go-swagger toolkit](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger).

## Adding new source code

When adding to the source base for oshinko-rest, it is important not to add
code in the auto-generated portions as it may be overwritten by future
regenerations. To this end, there are several locations which should be
avoided for new code:

* `client` directory
* `cmd/oshinko-rest-server/main.go`
* `models` directory
* `restapi` directory, aside from the file `restapi/configure_oshinko_rest.go`

These directories should be **avoided** when adding new source code. The
main point of contact for interacting with the server, and its internal
resources, is the file `restapi/configure_oshinko_rest.go`. This file will
not be touched by successive regenerations of the go-swagger based code. This
file also contains several entry point functions for interacting with the
server.

## Dependencies

This project is using the vendor experiment that was merged in Go language
version 1.5[[1]][ref1][[2]][ref2]. As such, **all** dependencies required by
oshinko-rest should be stored in the `vendor` directory at the top of the
project oshinko-cli (../vendor), they should not be included through the standard
`$GOPATH` mechanism.

The files under the vendor directory should be structured as if they were
under the `$GOPATH/src` directory for a Go language installation, with the
exeception that we should not commit git repositories. If your new code
requires an external dependency, it should be added to the vendor directory
with its fully qualified path as seen in an import statement.

For example, if I wish to add source code that requires me to import
`github.com/foo/bar`, then I should copy the contents of that repository
to the directory `../vendor/github.com/foo/bar` in this project.

In this manner, we can ensure that the dependency chain for the oshinko-rest
application will be frozen around the sources that are contained in the
vendor directory.

## Unit tests

All code that is contributed to this project should include unit tests that
exercise its functionality. Exceptions to this rule can be made in cases
where the underlying functions rely on difficult to configure resources or
the code is simple enough as to not have multiple execution paths.

The unit tests reside in the `tests/unit` directory, and are namespaced in
the `unittest` package. The [gocheck][gocheckurl] framework is
being used to structure these tests. To examine the suite structure or
test runner hooks see the `tests/unit/configure_test.go` file.

New tests should be added to files in the `tests/unit` directory, and should
be named in the pattern of `<topic>_test.go`. Any function that matches
the type and name of `func (*OshinkoUnitTestSuite) TestXxx (*check.C)` will
be executed.

The `OshinkoUnitTestSuite` structure can be found in the
`tests/unit/configure_test.go` file. It can be modified with information
that may need to be passed in to a test, or state that must be maintained
between tests. This file also contains several functions that can be used
for setting up and tearing down test or suites.

To run these tests use the `test` target in the Makefile.

### Example unit test

This example shows a simple test being added to a file named
`tests/unit/example_test.go`.

```
package unittest

import (
	"gopkg.in/check.v1"
)

func (s *OshinkoUnitTestSuite) TestExample(c *check.C) {
    c.Assert(true, check.Equals, true)
}
```

## Client tests

A suite of client tests exists in the `tests/client` directory. These tests
make use of the [gocheck][gocheckurl] framework that is used for the unit
tests. They work by instantiating a server and issuing client commands
against that server.

To write new client tests, it is strongly advised to investigate the
configuration code in `tests/client/configure_test.go`, and the
`TestCreateAndDeleteCluster` test in the
`tests/client/clusters_client_test.go` file. There are several features,
such as access to the server object, which are created as members of the
`OshinkoRestTestSuite` which will be helpful for test developers.

To run the client tests, the `tools/oshinko-test.sh` is provided to assist
with the OpenShift interactions. This script requires that you have access
to the `oc` command *and* that you are authenticated as a user with
permissions to perform all the admin functions required. Please inspect this
script for more details.

**Note** the client test script is not idempotent, it is meant to be run in
a project once. If it is re-rerun in the same project, it will fail with
errors about objects already existing. A new project should be used for each
run of the client test suite.
