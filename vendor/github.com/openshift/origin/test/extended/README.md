# OpenShift extended test suite

This document describes how a developer can write a new extended test for
OpenShift and the structure of extended tests.

Running tests
-------------

From the top-level origin directory, run

	$ test/extended/<some_script>.sh

Where \<some_script\>.sh is one of the bucket scripts such as "core.sh".

You can further narrow the set of tests being run by passing `--ginkgo.focus="some string"` where "some string" corresponds to
the description of the test you want to run.  For example one of the s2i tests (sti_incremental.go) defines:

	var _ = g.Describe("builds: s2i incremental build with push and pull to authenticated registry", func() {

So you can write a focus filter that includes this test by passing `--ginkgo.focus="s2i incremental"`.

Prerequisites
-----------

In order to execute the extended tests, you have to install
[Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) framework which is used in extended
tests. You can do it by running following command:

```console
$ go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
```

You also need to have the `openshift` binary in the `PATH` if you want to use
the shell script helpers to execute the extended tests.

Extended tests structure
------------------------

Extended tests live under the `./test/extended` directory in the origin repository.

The structure of this directory is following:

* [**`test/extended/util`**](util) provides useful helpers and utilities to use in your extended test. It provides a easy-to-use interface to OpenShift CLI and also
access to the Kubernetes [E2E framework](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/test/e2e) helpers. It also contains OpenShift helpers that are shared across multiple test cases, to make the test cases more DRY.
* [**`test/extended/fixtures`**](fixtures) contains the JSON and YAML fixtures that are meant to be used by the extended tests.
* [**`test/extended/[images,builds,...]`**](builds) each of these Go packages contains extended tests that are related to each other. For example, the `images` directory should contain test cases that are exercising usage of various Docker images in OpenShift.
* [**`hack/test-extended/[group]/run.sh`**](../../hack/test-extended) is the shell script that sets up any needed dependencies and then launches the extended tests whose top level ginkgo spec's Describe call reference the [group](#groups-vs-packages)
* [**`test/extended/extended_test.go`**](extended_test.go) is a runner for all extended test packages. Look inside this file to see how you can add new extended test Go package to be compiled:
```go
	_ "github.com/openshift/origin/test/extended/builds"
	_ "github.com/openshift/origin/test/extended/images"
```

Groups vs. packages
-------------------

Each type of functional test should be in its own package. However, if your
package needs to specifically configure the server in a different way than
the standard path, you would create a new launcher script with the same name
as your package in the `test/extended` dir.

For example, you might want to write an extended test for the LDAP
authentication which means that you have to configure the OpenShift server to
enable this authentication method. You can create a new test group `ldap` and
provide a shell launcher `./test/extended/ldap.sh` to start OpenShift with the
required configuration.

Then you place the source code for the extended test into the extended test Go
package that corresponds to functionality you are going to test. In the case of
LDAP, it can be `./test/extended/ldap`. You should include a prefix for your
test cases at your root suite level.

Example:
```go
var _ = g.Describe("[ldap] Authenticate using LDAP", func() {
  # ...
})
```

Creating new test group runner
------------------------------

If your test requires different configuration than the rest of the extended
test cases, you should create a new execution script in `test/extended`. Be
sure to set your focus to ginkgo appropriately to select only your test.

If your tests cannot run as part of the default group, be sure to ensure your
package is not included by `test/extended`.

Bash helpers for creating new test group runner
-----------------------------------------------

Common functions for extended tests are located in `./hack/util.sh`. Environment setup scripts are located in `hack/lib/util/evironment.sh`.

* `ginkgo_check_extended()` verify if the Ginkgo binary is installed.
* `compile_extended()` perform the compilation of the Go tests into a test binary.
* `test_privileges()` verify if you have permissions to start OpenShift server.
* `os::util::environment::setup_all_server_vars()` setup all required environment variables related to OpenShift server.
* `os::start::configure_server()` generates all configuration files for OpenShift server.
* `os::start::server()` starts the OpenShift master and node.
* `os::start::router()` installs the OpenShift router service.
* `os::start::registry()` installs the OpenShift Docker registry service.
* `create_image_streams_extended()` creates ImageStream(s) for all OpenShift images.

CLI interface
-------------

In order to be able to call the OpenShift CLI and Kubernetes and OpenShift REST clients and simulate the OpenShift `oc` command in the test suite, first we need to create an instance of the CLI, in the top-level Ginkgo describe container.
The top-level describe container should also specify the bucket into which the test belongs and a short test description. Other globally accessible variables (eg. fixtures) can be declared as well.

```go
package extended

import (
    g "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    o "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

var _ = g.Describe("[<test bucket>] <Testing scenario>", func() {
	defer g.GinkgoRecover()
	var (
		oc = exutil.NewCLI("test-name", exutil.KubeConfigPath())
		testFixture = filepath.Join("testdata", "test.json")
	)
})
```

The test suite should be organized into lower-level Ginkgo describe(s) container, together with a message which elaborates on the goal of the test. Inside each lower-level describe container specify a single spec with the `It` container , which shares the context in which the spec runs. The `It` container also takes a message which explains how the test goal will be achieved.

```go
var _ = g.Describe("[default] STI build", func() {
	defer GinkgoRecover()
	var (
		stiBuildFixture = filepath.Join("testdata", "test-build.json")
		oc              = exutil.NewCLI("build-sti", kubeConfigPath())
	)

	g.Describe("Building from a template", func() {
		g.It(fmt.Sprintf("should create a image from %q template", stiBuildFixture), func() {
			...
		}
	}
}
```

After that you are free to simulate any `oc` command by calling the CLI methods from the extended package.

As first, the command verb (get, create, start-build, ...) has to be specified upon the created CLI instance with the `Run()` method.
```go
oc = oc.Run("create")
```

Then the command parameters have to be specified by using the `Args()` command. You may also notice the methods can be easily chained.
```go
oc = oc.Run("create").Args("-f", testFixture)
```

A Go template can be set as a parameter for the OpenShift CLI command, by using the `Template()` method. Keep in mind that in order to use this method, the `get` verb has to be specified by the `Run()` command.
```go
oc = oc.Run("get").Args("foo").Template("{{ .spec }}")
```
is an equivalent to
```console
$ oc get foo -o template --template='{{ .spec }}'
```

To execute the command you will need to call either `Execute()`, which will execute the command and return any error that occurs, or `Output()`  which returns any error that occurs as well as the output.

```go
err := oc.Run("create").Args("-f", testFixture).Execute()
```
```go
buildName, err := oc.Run("start-build").Args("test").Output()
```

To print out the purpose of the next command, or set of commands, use the Ginkgo’s `By` function.
```go
g.By("starting a test build")
buildName, err := oc.Run("start-build").Args("test").Output()
```

To evaluate if the the command was successfully executed without any errors retrieved, use the Gomega’s `Expect` syntax to make expectations on the error.
```go
err = oc.Run("create").Args("-f", stiEnvBuildFixture).Execute()
o.Expect(err).NotTo(o.HaveOccurred())
```
