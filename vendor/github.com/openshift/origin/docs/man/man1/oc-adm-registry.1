.SH NAME
.PP
oc adm registry \- Install the integrated Docker registry


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoc adm registry\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Install or configure an integrated Docker registry

.PP
This command sets up a Docker registry integrated with your cluster to provide notifications when images are pushed. With no arguments, the command will check for the existing registry service called 'docker\-registry' and try to create it. If you want to test whether the registry has been created add the \-\-dry\-run flag and the command will exit with 1 if the registry does not exist.

.PP
To run a highly available registry, you should be using a remote storage mechanism like an object store (several are supported by the Docker registry). The default Docker registry image is configured to accept configuration as environment variables \- refer to the configuration file in that image for more on setting up alternative storage. Once you've made those changes, you can pass \-\-replicas=2 or higher to ensure you have failover protection. The default registry setup uses a local volume and the data will be lost if you delete the running pod.

.PP
If multiple ports are specified using the option \-\-ports, the first specified port will be chosen for use as the REGISTRY HTTP ADDR and will be passed to Docker registry.

.PP
NOTE: This command is intended to simplify the tasks of setting up a Docker registry in a new installation. Some configuration beyond this command is still required to make your registry persist data.
