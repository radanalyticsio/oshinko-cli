.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Print the logs for a resource

.PP
Supported resources are builds, build configs (bc), deployment configs (dc), and pods. When a pod is specified and has more than one container, the container name should be specified via \-c. When a build config or deployment config is specified, you can view the logs for a particular version of it via \-\-version.

.PP
If your pod is failing to start, you may need to use the \-\-previous option to see the logs of the last attempt.
