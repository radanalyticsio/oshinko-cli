.SH NAME
.PP
oc serviceaccounts new\-token \- Generate a new token for a service account.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoc serviceaccounts new\-token\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generate a new token for a service account.

.PP
Service account API tokens are used by service accounts to authenticate to the API. This command will generate a new token, which could be used to compartmentalize service account actions by executing them with distinct tokens, to rotate out pre\-existing token on the service account, or for use by an external client. If a label is provided, it will be applied to any created token so that tokens created with this command can be idenitifed.
