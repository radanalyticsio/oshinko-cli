.SH NAME
.PP
oc delete \- Delete one or more resources


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoc delete\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Delete a resource

.PP
JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

.PP
If both a filename and command line arguments are passed, the command line arguments are used and the filename is ignored.

.PP
Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

    [\-all] to select all the specified resources.

.PP
\fB\-\-cascade\fP=true
