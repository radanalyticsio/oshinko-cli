.SH NAME
.PP
oc import docker\-compose \- Import a docker\-compose.yml project into OpenShift (experimental)


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoc import docker\-compose\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Import a Docker Compose file as OpenShift objects

.PP
Docker Compose files offer a container centric build and deploy pattern for simple applications. This command will transform a provided docker\-compose.yml application into its OpenShift equivalent. During transformation fields in the compose syntax that are not relevant when running on top of a containerized platform will be ignored and a warning printed.

.PP
The command will create objects unless you pass the \-o yaml or \-\-as\-template flags to generate a configuration file for later use.

.PP
Experimental: This command is under active development and may change without notice.
