.SH NAME
.PP
openshift cli rollback \- Revert part of an application back to a previous deployment


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift cli rollback\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Revert an application back to a previous deployment

.PP
When you run this command your deployment configuration will be updated to match a previous deployment. By default only the pod and container configuration will be changed and scaling or trigger settings will be left as\- is. Note that environment variables and volumes are included in rollbacks, so if you've recently updated security credentials in your environment your previous deployment may not have the correct values.

.PP
Any image triggers present in the rolled back configuration will be disabled with a warning. This is to help prevent your rolled back deployment from being replaced by a triggered deployment soon after your rollback. To re\-enable the triggers, use the 'deploy' command.

.PP
If you would like to review the outcome of the rollback, pass '\-\-dry\-run' to print a human\-readable representation of the updated deployment configuration instead of executing the rollback. This is useful if you're not quite sure what the outcome will be.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-change\-scaling\-settings\fP=false
    Include the previous deployment's replicationController replica count and selector in the rollback

.PP
\fB\-\-change\-strategy\fP=false
    Include the previous deployment's strategy in the rollback

.PP
\fB\-\-change\-triggers\fP=false
    Include the previous deployment's triggers in the rollback

.PP
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP=false
    Instead of performing the rollback, describe what the rollback will look like in human\-readable form

.PP
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP=""
    Instead of performing the rollback, print the updated deployment configuration in the specified format (json|yaml|name|template|templatefile)

.PP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-template\fP=""
    Template string or path to template file to use when \-o=template or \-o=templatefile.

.PP
\fB\-\-to\-version\fP=0
    A config version to rollback to. Specifying version 0 is the same as omitting a version (the version will be auto\-detected). This option is ignored when specifying a deployment.
