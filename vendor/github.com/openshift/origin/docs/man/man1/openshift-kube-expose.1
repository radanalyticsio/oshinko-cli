.SH NAME
.PP
openshift kube expose \- Take a replication controller, service, deployment or pod and expose it as a new Kubernetes Service


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift kube expose\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Expose a resource as a new Kubernetes service.

.PP
Looks up a deployment, service, replica set, replication controller or pod by name and uses the selector
for that resource as the selector for a new service on the specified port. A deployment or replica set
will be exposed as a service only if its selector is convertible to a selector that service supports,
i.e. when the selector contains only the matchLabels component. Note that if no port is specified via
\-\-port and the exposed resource has multiple ports, all will be re\-used by the new service. Also if no
labels are specified, the new service will re\-use the labels from the resource it exposes.

.PP
Possible resources include (case insensitive):
pod (po), service (svc), replicationcontroller (rc),
deployment (deploy), replicaset (rs)


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-cluster\-ip\fP=""
    ClusterIP to be assigned to the service. Leave empty to auto\-allocate, or set to 'None' to create a headless service.

.PP
\fB\-\-container\-port\fP=""
    Synonym for \-\-target\-port

.PP
\fB\-\-create\-external\-load\-balancer\fP=false
    If true, create an external load balancer for this service (trumped by \-\-type). Implementation is cloud provider dependent. Default is 'false'.

.PP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fP=false
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.

.PP
\fB\-\-external\-ip\fP=""
    Additional external IP address (not managed by Kubernetes) to accept for the service. If this IP is routed to a node, the service can be accessed by this IP in addition to its generated service IP.

    Filename, directory, or URL to a file identifying the resource to expose a service

.PP
\fB\-\-generator\fP="service/v2"
    The name of the API generator to use. There are 2 generators: 'service/v1' and 'service/v2'. The only difference between them is that service port in v1 is named 'default', while it is left unnamed in v2. Default is 'service/v2'.

.PP
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-labels\fP=""
    Labels to apply to the service created by this call.

.PP
\fB\-\-load\-balancer\-ip\fP=""

    The port that the service should serve on. Copied from the resource being exposed, if unspecified

.PP
\fB\-\-protocol\fP=""
    The network protocol for the service to be created. Default is 'TCP'.

.PP
\fB\-\-record\fP=false
