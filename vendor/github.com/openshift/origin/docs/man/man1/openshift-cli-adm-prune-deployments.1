    Per DeploymentConfig, specify the number of deployments whose status is complete that will be preserved whose replica size is 0.

.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-failed\fP=1
    Per DeploymentConfig, specify the number of deployments whose status is failed that will be preserved whose replica size is 0.

.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-younger\-than\fP=0
    Specify the minimum age of a deployment for it to be considered a candidate for pruning.

.PP
\fB\-\-orphans\fP=false
    Prune all deployments where the associated DeploymentConfig no longer exists, the status is complete or failed, and the replica size is 0.
