.SH NAME
.PP
oadm migrate storage \- Update the stored version of API objects


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoadm migrate storage\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Migrate internal object storage via update

.PP
This command invokes an update operation on every API object reachable by the caller. This forces the server to write to the underlying storage if the object representation has changed. Use this command to ensure that the most recent storage changes have been applied to all objects (storage version, storage encoding, any newer object defaults).

.PP
To operate on a subset of resources, use the \-\-include flag. If you encounter errors during a run the command will output a list of resources that received errors, which you can then re\-run the command on. You may also specify \-\-from\-key and \-\-to\-key to restrict the set of resource names to operate on (key is NAMESPACE/NAME for resources in namespaces or NAME for cluster scoped resources). \-\-from\-key is inclusive if specified, while \-\-to\-key is exclusive.

.PP
By default, events are not migrated since they expire within a very short period of time. If you have significantly increased the expiration time of events, run a migration with \-\-include=events

.PP
WARNING: This is a slow command and will put significant load on an API server. It may also result in significant intra\-cluster traffic.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-all\-namespaces\fP=true
    Migrate objects in all namespaces. Defaults to true.

.PP
\fB\-\-confirm\fP=false
    If true, all requested objects will be migrated. Defaults to false.

.PP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-filename\fP=[]
    Filename, directory, or URL to docker\-compose.yml file to use

    If specified, only migrate items with a key (namespace/name or name) greater than or equal to this value

.PP
\fB\-\-include\fP=[*]
    Resource types to migrate. Passing \-\-filename will override this flag.

.PP
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP=""
    Output the modified objects instead of saving them, valid values are 'yaml' or 'json'

.PP
\fB\-\-to\-key\fP=""

.PP
\fB\-\-request\-timeout\fP="0"
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non\-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
