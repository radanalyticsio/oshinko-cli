.SH NAME
.PP
oc deploy \- View, start, cancel, or retry a deployment


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoc deploy\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
View, start, cancel, or retry a deployment

.PP
This command allows you to control a deployment config. Each individual deployment is exposed as a new replication controller, and the deployment process manages scaling down old deployments and scaling up new ones. Use 'oc rollback' to rollback to any previous deployment.

.PP
There are several deployment strategies defined:
.IP 

.IP
\(bu Rolling (default) \- scales up the new deployment in stages, gradually reducing the number of old deployments. If one of the new deployed pods never becomes "ready", the new deployment will be rolled back (scaled down to zero). Use when your application can tolerate two versions of code running at the same time (many web applications, scalable databases)
.br
.IP
\(bu Recreate \- scales the old deployment down to zero, then scales the new deployment up to full. Use when your application cannot tolerate two versions of code running at the same time
.br
.IP
\(bu Custom \- run your own deployment process inside a Docker container using your own scripts.
.br
.PP
If a deployment fails, you may opt to retry it (if the error was transient). Some deployments may never successfully complete \- in which case you can use the '\-\-latest' flag to force a redeployment. If a deployment config has completed deploying successfully at least once in the past, it would be automatically rolled back in the event of a new failed deployment. Note that you would still need to update the erroneous deployment config in order to have its template persisted across your application.

.PP
If you want to cancel a running deployment, use '\-\-cancel' but keep in mind that this is a best\-effort operation and may take some time to complete. Itâ€™s possible the deployment will partially or totally complete before the cancellation is effective. In such a case an appropriate event will be emitted.

.PP
If no options are given, shows information about the latest deployment.
