.SH NAME
.PP
openshift cli rsh \- Start a shell session in a pod


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift cli rsh\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Open a remote shell session to a container

.PP
This command will attempt to start a shell session in a pod for the specified resource. It works with pods, deployment configs, jobs, daemon sets, and replication controllers. Any of the aforementioned resources (apart from pods) will be resolved to a ready pod. It will default to the first container if none is specified, and will attempt to use '/bin/sh' as the default shell. You may pass any flags supported by this command before the resource name, and an optional command after the resource name, which will be executed instead of a login shell. A TTY will be automatically allocated if standard input is interactive \- use \-t and \-T to override. A TERM variable is sent to the environment where the shell (or command) will be executed. By default its value is the same as the TERM variable from the local environment; if not set, 'xterm' is used.

.PP
Note, some containers may not include a shell \- use 'openshift cli exec' if you need to run commands directly.
