.SH NAME
.PP
openshift cli debug \- Launch a new instance of a pod for debugging


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift cli debug\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Launch a command shell to debug a running application

.PP
When debugging images and setup problems, it's useful to get an exact copy of a running pod configuration and troubleshoot with a shell. Since a pod that is failing may not be started and not accessible to 'rsh' or 'exec', the 'debug' command makes it easy to create a carbon copy of that setup.

.PP
The default mode is to start a shell inside of the first container of the referenced pod, replication controller, or deployment config. The started pod will be a copy of your source pod, with labels stripped, the command changed to '/bin/sh', and readiness and liveness checks disabled. If you just want to run a command, add '\-\-' and a command to run. Passing a command will not create a TTY or send STDIN by default. Other flags are supported for altering the container or pod in common ways.

.PP
A common problem running containers is a security policy that prohibits you from running as a root user on the cluster. You can use this command to test running a pod as non\-root (with \-\-as\-user) or to run a non\-root pod as root (with \-\-as\-root).

.PP
The debug pod is deleted when the the remote command completes or the user interrupts the shell.
