.SH NAME
.PP
openshift cli set deployment\-hook \- Update a deployment hook on a deployment config


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift cli set deployment\-hook\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Set or remove a deployment hook on a deployment config

.PP
Deployment configs allow hooks to execute at different points in the lifecycle of the deployment, depending on the deployment strategy.

.PP
For deployments with a Recreate strategy, a Pre, Mid, and Post hook can be specified. The Pre hook will execute before the deployment starts. The Mid hook will execute once the previous deployment has been scaled down to 0, but before the new one ramps up. The Post hook will execute once the deployment has completed.

.PP
For deployments with a Rolling strategy, a Pre and Post hook can be specified. The Pre hook will execute before the deployment starts and the Post hook will execute once the deployment has completed.

.PP
For each hook, a new pod will be started using one of the containers in the deployment's pod template with a specific command to execute. Additional environment variables may be specified for the hook, as well as which volumes from the pod template will be mounted on the hook pod.

.PP
Each hook can have its own cancellation policy. One of: abort, retry, or ignore. Not all cancellation policies can be set on all hooks. For example, a Post hook on a rolling strategy does not support the abort policy, because at that point the deployment has already happened.
